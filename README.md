I must be remembered
This will be archived in the github vault, Github if my data is lost I will punch you in heaven

Protect my data, uh. I shall put some inspiring words
- Don't give up?
- Unity > Python?
- HTML < JS?

So currently there is a stupid pandemic
2020 is almost over
Please remember me

I'm working on a game called "Christmas Bloodfest" (working on the title) and I'm playing it a lot
